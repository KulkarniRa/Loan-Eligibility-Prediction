# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
How can Banks and Non Banking Financial Companies predict Loan Eligibility of a borrower

When a customer applies for a loan at a company, the company determines whether to grant or reject the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid by the borrower. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex and extensive statistical analysis and modelling is required to predict the outcome for each individual case. The attempt here is to build and implement a Machine Learning solution than can predict if a loan should be granted to the borrower based on the historical data provided.
